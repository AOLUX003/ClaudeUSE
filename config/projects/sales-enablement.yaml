notes: |
  **Sales Philosophy:**
  - Sell outcomes, not features
  - Lead with customer pain, follow with quantified value
  - ROI calculators concrete and credible (confidence levels)
  - Competitive positioning through differentiation, not feature checklists

  **ICIP Example ROI:**
  Customer with 10K devices spending $20K/month connectivity.
  - Current state: $240K/year + $20K labor for manual comparison = $260K
  - With ICIP: Optimized to $192K/year (20% savings) + $2K labor = $194K
  - Net savings: $66K/year
  - ROI: 13,200% on $500/month ICIP subscription
  - Confidence: Medium (assumes 20% optimization, varies per customer)

  **Key Differentiators:**
  - ICIP: Purchase ≠ activation separation (only solution accurate from Day 1)
  - LuxenOS: Sovereign memory with causal reasoning (not just RAG retrieval)
