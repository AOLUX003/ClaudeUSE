notes: |
  **Core Insight:** Humans move fast, think compressed/associative, struggle to break down
  chain of thought for AI instruction. AI needs explicit, structured, progressive disclosure.

  **Key Gaps Identified:**
  1. **Context Window Management**: Humans assume AI remembers everything; AI has token limits
  2. **Implicit Knowledge**: Humans assume shared context; AI needs explicit instructions
  3. **Unknown Unknowns**: Humans identify blind spots naturally; AI needs prompting
  4. **Compressed Communication**: Humans shorthand; AI benefits from structure
  5. **Documentation Obesity**: Humans create bloated docs; AI prefers tiered disclosure

  **Bridging Patterns:**
  - Three-tier architecture: Always-loaded → Context-activated → On-demand
  - Confidence tagging: High/Medium/Low on all recommendations
  - Explicit assumptions: Separate "known" from "assumed"
  - Unknown unknowns section: ALWAYS include potential blind spots
  - Bold key insights: **Highlight for scanning**

  **Real-World Examples:**
  - .cursorrules consolidation: 5,869 lines → 3-file system (60% reduction)
  - Memory extraction: 70% length reduction, 100% strategic value retention
  - Project configs: One file per project vs scattered context
